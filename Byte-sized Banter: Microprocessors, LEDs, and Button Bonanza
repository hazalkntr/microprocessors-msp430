This project explores the teamwork of two microprocessors, Microprocessor A and
Microprocessor B. Our goal is to make Microprocessor A, which has a button, control a colored
LED connected to Microprocessor B. The result we aim for is a simple toggle effect on the LED
â€“ turning it on if it's off and off if it's on.
